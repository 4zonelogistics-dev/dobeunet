## 6. Dual Intercom Integration

### Implementation Strategy:
The current implementation uses a single Intercom workspace (xu0gfiqb) with conditional configuration:

- **Pre-Login (Sales Focus)**:
  - Loads without user identification
  - Positioned for lead generation
  - Default welcome message for prospects

- **Post-Login (Support Focus)**:
  - Includes user identification
  - User metadata (name, email, created_at)
  - Personalized support experience

### File:
- `/src/components/IntercomManager.tsx`

### Note:
For true dual-workspace setup, you would need two separate Intercom app IDs - one for sales and one for support. The current implementation provides the framework for easy upgrade when additional workspace is configured.
